# Statistical Machine Learning

This repository contains all assignments and personal notes for the course "Statistical Machine Learning" (NWI-IMC056) given at the Radboud University. 

The chapters and exercises are based on the book **Christopher M. Bishop. 2006. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Information Science and Statistics). Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg** and is used throughout this course.

The "notebooks" folder contains Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples and additional details based on the discussed chapters.
