A factory produces products $X$. 80% is of quality $x = 1$ and the remainder of quality $x = 2$. There is a test $Z$, which can be a real number $z$ between 0 and 1. The conditional probability density of $z$, depending on the quality of $z$ is 

\begin{align*}
p(z | x = 1) &= \alpha_1(1 - z)\\
p(z | x = 2) &= \alpha_2z
\end{align*}
